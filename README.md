# Maodoro
Cat nuisance based pomodoro. çŒ« + doro.

Every cat owner knows the joy of having your cat sit right on top of your keyboard. Maodoro aims to bring this experience to everyone.

Around every 20 minutes (the exact timing is customizable), a cat walks across your computer screen and prevents you from browsing the internet, until you can push him away. Coincidentally, this is about the same time when you should be taking a break from your computer, and maodoro encourages you to do so.
